## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and written report for a personal project on automatic sequencing of music playlists, with a focus on hip hop dance music.

## Description

The project extracts meaningful features from songs, with an emphasis on drum patterns. This involves detecting drum types and aligning events on a rhythmic grid. Based on these features, a similarity score is computed between songs, and a sequencing algorithm finds an order that maximizes similarity between consecutive tracks.

## Notes

- The datasets and trained models are not included.
- The notebook is provided for reference only and cannot be executed.
